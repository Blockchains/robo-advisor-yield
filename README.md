# The Robo-Advisor for Yield

Staked introduces the Robo-Advisor for Yield (RAY), the easiest way to earn the highest yield on ETH, DAI, and USDC holdings. Users deposit funds into the RAY smart contract, customize which protocols should be considered, and an off-chain oracle monitors rates on eligible protocols. RAY automatically moves funds to the highest-yielding at option at any time. Users receive an ERC-721 token representing the value of positions they own.

RAY will support an expanding number of yield-generating opportunities, with initial support for Compound, dYdX, and bZx. Decisions about which protocols will be supported and key system variables will be handled through governance. This allows capital providers and smart contract authors to collaborate profitably in a decentralized manner.

RAY is a work in progress and several anticipated features have yet to be implemented. Please see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/wiki#roadmap) and [contact us](https://t.me/staked_official) if you have suggestions for greater clarity or better functionality.
